In the palette called "SUPR" a field labelled as "Widget" is available. This field contains any widget that is managed in the configured SUPR account.
By selecting a widget, a preview of the selection gets rendered.

   This is a simulated preview of the selected widget. It does not represent the actual look and feel and is only intended to give a visual hint which widget is selected.
